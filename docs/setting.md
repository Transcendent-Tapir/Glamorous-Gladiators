## Mooreth: The Lonely Peninsula

While you are free (and encouraged!) to create your own setting for Glamorous Gladiators, it comes with a default setting: 
A wondrous technomagical setting known as Mooreth: The lonely peninsula. It contains a number of biomes, contains technology like engines and firearms, powered by both magic and familiar technology like steam engines and gunpowder.

Mooreth is a long curved peninsula, with mountains in the north and south. Much of the central is a vast forest, with the eastern coast having beautiful beaches. In the eastern bay lies an uninhabited island. The northeast and southwest are home to smaller peninsulas and small island chains To the north of the Plateau is a large lake known as the Great Sun Lake. To the east of the peninsula is Moon Island, an uninhabited wildland.

This is a realm of magic and adventure, with living dungeons, bustling cities, rural villages, beautiful islands, corrupt leaders, bandits, pirates, and monstrous beasts. Gladiators go out into the world seeking fame, fortune, power, and revenge. 

Powerful people rule over the lands and often take the titles of royalty, such as sovereign, lord, duchess, etc. The titles themselves have no meaning, and reflect only the preference of the person.

Notable Factions:
- The Silver Corsairs: A pirate fleet that controls much of the seas, contains a number of pirate lords
- Fiber collective: A guild consisting of the farmers and weavers that make clothing
- The Highland Nobles: A royal family in the northern plateau
- Dungeoneers Guild: A guild of those who explore and manage the magical dungeons
- Merchants and Missives: A guild of letter carriers, merchants, and escorts.
- Gladiators Guild: A collection of Gladiators as well as those that manage the contracts and quest gems.

## Quests

The game is built around quests, which have sponsors. Sponsors go to the Gladiators Guild to get a Quest gem created, which a Gladiator can then pick up, and slot into their preferred jewelry. This gem serves as a contract for the quest and allows the Sponsor to observe their gladiator. Watch parties often form for large quests, and some Sponsors create quests purely for the show in order to get viewers. Most sponsors will be sovereigns, but sometimes a guild, a group of workers, or other individuals will sponsor a quest. 

There are also illicit quests, which do not go through the guild. The gems are made through other means, and can contain unknown and unstable magic. These quests are generally more dangerous, they are taken by the desperate, stupid, and those addicted to danger. Sometimes the pay for an illicit quest is incredibly high, however most of the time the people taking on these quests are coerced into doing them through blackmail and debts.

Sponsors also often provide the Supplies you will have on your Quest. Sometimes they will give you specific items, other times you will receive a certain amount of dice to assign as you wish, or it can be a mix of the two.

~~A dark gunpowder fantasy world known as The Desolate Frontier. 

In The Desolate Frontier, magic is alive and well, and more dangerous than ever. People generally live in settlements the size of small cities, there are few well tread paths between them. The land is full of dangerous beasts and even deadlier bandits, gangs, and generally desperate people. The cities are kept relatively safe by high walls, and torches that burn a magic infused fuel to repel the beasts. Security is strict inside of them.

The Gladiators venture beyond these walls looking for fame, fortune, power, or vengeance. They'll confront many powerful foes and explore the magical dungeons, which are more like living magical beings than abandoned human architecture.

Scenarios:
- Part of an organization protecting this realm from beings of the spirit realm
- In a school for empowered people
- A team of reluctant allies fighting against certain doom
- Transported to another world and fighting to find your way back home
- A crew looking for something powerful that may not exist 
- Powers started awakening and the world is in chaos
- The World Ended and you're fighting to survive
- You are selected by ancient beings as protectors and they bestow you with tremendous power
- You pilot specialized machines in order to protect the world 
- A corrupting evil force has descended upon a once peaceful land, and you answer the call to fight it
- In a dangerous land where people live in protected settlements, you are a team that leaves to gather supplies and trade with other cities
