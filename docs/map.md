Combat is broken up into zones, and weapons have ranges that tell you how many zones away you can attack from. Some weapons or special techniques allow you to attack from a further range. You can always defend regarldess of distance. For every zone outside of your weapons preferred range, you lower your weapon die unless a special technique would dictate otherwise.

Preferred Range is a number that describes the number of zones that a weapon should be used from. 0 is for enemies within the same zone.

Zones are broken in whatever way makes the most sense for the fight. Often a zone will be the size of a small room. However, a fight on an airplane might have you breaking the cabin into multiple zones separated by 4 or so rows of seats. If you have a large battlefield, it might make more sense for a zone to be a small building, or relatively large areas between solid cover. If you are in the same zone as an enemy, you must make a roll to leave. Special techniques that allow you to move to another zone bypass this when used successfully.

To move into a zone defended by an opposing character, you must make a roll to overcome their defense.

Some zones will have Hazards. A Hazard is an aspect of the environment that counts as a negative to every character within that zone. Some examples could be that the zone is on fire, a crumbling cliffside, covered in spikes, in complete darkness, or a pool of acid. A Hazard will have a die rating from d4 to d12, like any other asset. 

Some Hazards are active threats that grow over time. These are called Disasters, they can be represented by a pool of dice, rather than a single die. When in a zone with a disaster, the highest die in that zones disaster pool works as a hazard and counts as a negative condition.

At the end of each turn the Disaster can spread to a new zone, gain an additional die, or go up a die size. Each zone affected by the Disaster will have its own Disaster dice. For each Disaster roll on the table below to determine how it gets worse at the end of a round.

D6 | Disaster Growth
:-: | :-:
1-2 | Expand to an adjacent zone
3-4 | Raise one die
5-6 | Add an additional die to the pool in any zone 

To fight a Disaster, a character must take an appropriate action to deal with it, such as smothering or putting water on a fire. Get creative and use your abilities and assets to find a way to deal with them. When fighting a Disaster, roll against the entire Dice pool.
