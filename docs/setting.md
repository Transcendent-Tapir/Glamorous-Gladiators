While you are free (and encouraged!) to create your own setting for Glamorous Gladiators, it comes with a default setting: A dark gunpowder fantasy world known as The Desolate Frontier. 

In The Desolate Frontier, magic is alive and well, and more dangerous than ever. People generally live in settlements the size of small cities, there are few well tread paths between them. The land is full of dangerous beasts and even deadlier bandits, gangs, and generally desperate people. The cities are kept relatively safe by high walls, and torches that burn a magic infused fuel to repel the beasts. Security is strict inside of them.

The Gladiators venture beyond these walls looking for fame, fortune, power, or vengeance. They'll confront many powerful foes and explore the magical dungeons, which are more like living magical beings than abandoned human architecture.
