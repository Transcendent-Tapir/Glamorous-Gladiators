Inspiration and Advancement will be Spark and Stride

Spark is gained whenever you take on stress, or when one of your scars is triggered.

You have a maximum of 5 spark. 5 spark can be traded for 1 stride

Spark can be used to activate special techniques, use a strength that is not applicable, target a specific stress track on an opponent, or take advantage of an opponents scar.

Stride allows you to upgrade your character

Cost | Reward
-: | :-
1 | Unlock a new D6 Special Technique, Upgrade a stat or aspect from d4 to d6
2 | Upgrade a stat, aspect or special technique from d6 to d8
3 | Upgrade a stat, aspect, or special technique from d8 to d10
4 | Upgrade a stat, aspect, or special technique from d10 to d12

Spending Stride during an interaction allows you to add the newly unlocked or upgraded die to your pool twice.

Weapons do not upgrade with Stride, instead they are upgraded through working with a weaponsmith or being rewarded with a new weapon. This also allows for magical upgrades that work akin to special techniques. These special upgrades are tied to the weapon and will be lost if the weapon is lost.
