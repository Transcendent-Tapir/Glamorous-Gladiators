## Quests

The game is built around quests, which have sponsors. Sponsors go to the Gladiators Guild to get a Quest gem created, which a Gladiator can then pick up, and slot into their preferred jewelry. This gem serves as a contract for the quest and allows the Sponsor to observe their gladiator. Watch parties often form for large quests, and some Sponsors create quests purely for the show in order to get viewers. Most sponsors will be sovereigns, but sometimes a guild, a group of workers, or other individuals will sponsor a quest. 

There are also illicit quests, which do not go through the guild. The gems are made through other means, and can contain unknown and unstable magic. These quests are generally more dangerous, they are taken by the desperate, stupid, and those addicted to danger. Sometimes the pay for an illicit quest is incredibly high, however most of the time the people taking on these quests are coerced into doing them through blackmail and debts.

Sponsors also often provide the Supplies you will have on your Quest. Sometimes they will give you specific items, other times you will receive a certain amount of dice to assign as you wish, or it can be a mix of the two.

## Sponsors

Every quest has a sponsor, usually a rich person with a royal title, or a local community. with each quest, your sponsor will also supply you equipment. Rewards for quests can be increasing your connection to your sponsor and upgrades to your signature equipment. Higher connection also means better quests, unlocking better equipment and allies.

You can have as many sponsors as you have quests. There is a limit on sponsor connection. For royal connections, they will drop to tier 1 if any other sponsor is raised above tier 1. For community sponsors, they will drop to tier 1 if a royal sponsor is raised above tier 1.

Quests will often have optional objectives with extra rewards. These objectives are often there to increase viewership of your quest via crystal gaze.

Each Sponsor will offer unique rewards for each connection tier. Royal Sponsors tend to give material rewards, better weapons and armor, more equipment, and reluctant allies

Royal sponsors will only offer equipment and allies for quests by that sponsor. Royal sponsors are more likely to offer competitive quests, where only the gladiator that returns with the desired item will be rewarded. Royal Sponors offer riches and fame.

Community sponsors tend to offer lower rewards, but with the advantage that investing in one community doesn't take away from another, so you can more easily get the specific advantages that you need. 
Community connections can also offer equipment and allies on quests from other communities, or your personal quest.

Sometimes when a problem arises in an area, multiple quests will be offered to deal with it in different ways. A community quest might have you relocate a magical creature disrupting an area, where a royal sponsor would have you kill it.
